  # Note: There must always be at least a 2 datapoint difference between the scale-up and scaled-down datapoints.
  # >>>     Scale-Up requires  5 out of  5 data points (consecutive)     ...   25/5 = _5_
  # >>>   Scale-Down requires 57 out of 60 data points (non-consecutive) ...  285/5 = 57 and 300/5 = 60, 60-57 = _3_
  # The 2 datapoint difference references 60-57 = _3_ (scale-down) vs _5_ (scale-up). The reasoning for this difference is that you should never
  # be able to trigger a scale down immediately after a scale up. Say your throughput spiked just enough to scale up, then went away. Having > 3
  # consecutive datapoints above the scale-up threshold to trigger a scale-up means it's impossible to get 57 of 60 datapoints until you wait 300
  # minutes and those scale-up data points age out of the scale-down window.
  # Ok now the really confusing part: The reason 1 datapoint difference isn't enough is because we have 2 alarms and they can operate on slightly
  # different time alignments, internally, for calculating their datapoints, despite always showing datapoints at the 5 minute marks (12:05, 12:10
  # etc) in the graph. So you add 1 extra datapoint of difference, for a total of 2, to guard against this potential misalignment between the scale
  # up and scale-down alarms. You can see this internal difference by going to the alarm and looking at its history for an entry like "Alarm updated
  # from OK to In alarm" and clicking the time "2020-06-23 12:47:09" link on the row. The "newState" section will show the datapoints and their times
  # > "stateReason": "Threshold Crossed: 5 out of the last 5 datapoints [0.9162957064310709 (23/06/20 12:42:00), 0.934598798751831 (23/06/20 12:37:00...
  # As you can see these datapoints are not aligned along the 5 minute display boundary (12:05, 12:10) but rather 12:37, 12:42.
